cMIPS

cMIPS is a synthesizable VHDL model for the 5-stage pipeline, MIPS32r2 core.

The VHDL model mimics the pipeline design described in Patterson & Hennessy's
book (Computer Organisation and Design) and is a complete implementation
of the MIPS32r2 instruction set.

The model was synthesized for an Altera EP4CE30F23.  The model runs at 50 MHz
(top board speed) and uses up 15% of the combinational blocks and 5% of the
logic registers on the FPGA.

Processor model runs C code, compiled with GCC;  there are scripts to
compile and assemble code to run on the simulator or the FPGA.

Core has all forwarding paths and full interlocks for data and control hazards.

Coprocessor0 supports six hardware interrupts + NMI in "Interrupt
Compatibility Mode" and an 8-way fully associative TLB.  The control
instructions break, syscall, trap, mfc0, mtc0, eret, ei, di, ll, sc
are fully implemented.

Partial-word loads and stores (word, half-word, byte) implemented at the
processor's memory interface.

Testbench for tests includes processor, RAM, ROM and (simulator) file I/O.

Top level file for synthesis includes processor, RAM, ROM, LCD display
controller, 2x7segment LED display, keypad and UART.  SDRAM controller,
VGA interface and Ethernet port are in the works.
