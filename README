cMIPS

cMIPS - an FPGA ready VHDL model for 5-stage pipeline, MIPS32r2 core

The VHDL model mimics the pipeline design described in Patterson & Hennessy's
book (Computer Organisation and Design) and is an (almost) complete
implementation of the MIPS32r2 instruction set.

The model was synthesized for an Altera EP4CE30F23.  The model runs at 50 MHz
(top development board speed) and uses up 15% of combinational blocks and
5% of logic registers in the FPGA.

Processor model runs C code, compiled with GCC;  there are scripts to
compile and assemble code to run on the simulator or the FPGA.

Core has all forwarding paths and full interlocks for data and control hazards.

Coprocessor0 is partially implemented, six hardware interrupts + NMI in
"Interrupt Compatibility Mode";  TLB implementation will be available soon.

The control instructions break, syscall, trap, mfc0, mtc0, eret, ei, di, ll, sc
are fully implemented.

Partial-word loads and stores (word, half-word, byte) implemented at the
processor's memory interface.

Testbench for tests includes processor, RAM, ROM and (simulator) file I/O.

Top level file for synthesis includes processor, RAM, ROM, LCD display,
2x7segment LED display, keypad and UART.  TLB, SDRAM controller, VGA interface
are in the works.
