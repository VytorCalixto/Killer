cMIPS

cMIPS - an FPGA ready VHDL model for 5-stage pipeline, MIPS32r2 core

The VHDL model mimics the pipeline design described in Patterson & Hennessy's
book (Computer Organisation and Design) and is an (almost) complete
implementation of the MIPS32r2 instruction set.

The TLB and assorted control registers will be included soon (as of March 2015).

The model was synthesized for an Altera EP4CE30F23. The model uses up 15% of
combinational blocks and 5% logic registers of the FPGA.


Processor model runs C code, compiled with GCC;

Core has all forwarding paths and full interlocks for data and control hazards;

Coprocessor0 is partially implemented, six hardware interrupts + NMI in
"Interrupt Compatibility Mode";

The control instructions break, syscall, trap, mfc0, mtc0, eret, ei, di, ll, sc
are fully implemented;

Partial-word loads and stores (word, half-word, byte) implemented at the
processor's memory interface;

Testbench for tests includes processor, RAM, ROM and file I/O;

Top level file for synthesis includes processor, RAM, ROM, LCD display and
keyboard.  UART, SDRAM controller, VGA interface are in the works.
